# MyDash

MyDash is a simple self hosted browser dashboard launcher. There are many browser extensions that perform the same functionality, but they have access to your web browsing.  Those extensions simply have too many permissions from a security stand point. If all you need is a basic dashbaord, and you have a public facing website, then you have all you need. Just make this your default browser tab/homepage, and you will have your persoanl dashboard on any device.  Just edit the Tables with the URLS, and upload a .png to the images folder.  Voil√† you have a new entry in your dashboard!
