MyDash is a simple self hosted browser dashboard launcher. There are too many browser extensions that perform the same functionality, but they have to many permissions from a security stand point. If all you need is a basic dashbaord,and you have a public facing website, then you have all you need. Just make this your default browser tab/homepage,and you will have your persoanl dashboard on any device.
